# template_repo

## Template Instructions

Use this template by clicking the green `Use this template` button above to create a new repository.

Couple of things to keep in mind:
- Make sure to set the owner to the `DataPoint-Armenia` org when creating.
- Name your repo in the format `<project_name>_<repo_name>`
  - For example: **vortan_spellchecker**.
  - This helps keep things organized when you have many repos for one project.
- This template is just a guideline. Feel free to change things up to suit your own needs.
  - I would start by deleting this "Template Instructions" section and filling in the other sections as the project develops.
